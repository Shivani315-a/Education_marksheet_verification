# Education_marksheet_verification
Cloud-ready Marksheet Verification System built with Streamlit, EasyOCR, and RapidFuzz. Extracts text directly from PDF marksheets (no Poppler, no Tesseract) and verifies student name, surname, education level, and result status (Pass/Fail). Uses fuzzy matching to handle OCR errors and minor spelling variations for reliable verification.
